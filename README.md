# Panoptic Segmentation — Detectron2 baseline
This project focuses on panoptic segmentation, a unified computer vision task that simultaneously performs semantic segmentation (labeling each pixel with a class) and instance segmentation (distinguishing individual object instances). The repository provides an end-to-end training and inference pipeline built on Detectron2, adapted for maritime and unstructured environments, with support for panoptic annotations, dataset registration, and reproducible experimentation. The goal is to establish a strong, extensible baseline for panoptic scene understanding and future research improvements.
